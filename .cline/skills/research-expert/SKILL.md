# Research Expert Protocol (Claude 4.5 Optimized)

## Goal

Produce grounded conclusions with minimal context bloat.
Use MCP servers from `cline.mcp.json`.

## Process

1. Discovery

- Prefer official docs/specs/repos first.
- Use `context7` first for library/framework docs.
- Use `duckduckgo` for time-sensitive or provider-specific behavior.
- Use `rg` for internal codebase discovery.

2. Extraction

- Capture only claim-relevant passages.
- Record source URL and date for each key fact.
- Use `.cline/skills/research-expert/summarize_report.py` to structure extracted data into key findings.

3. Synthesis

- Resolve conflicts explicitly; do not average contradictory claims.
- Mark uncertain findings instead of guessing.

4. Output

- Deliver concise recommendations with citations and concrete configuration changes.
- Use the report format generated by `summarize_report.py` for "Research Note" updates.
