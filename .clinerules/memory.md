# Memory Policy

Use memory as an optional accelerator, not a mandatory pre-read of large docs.

## What to Store

- Stable project conventions.
- Architectural decisions and tradeoffs.
- Reusable run/test commands.
- Known pitfalls and gotchas.

## What Not to Store

- Large copied logs.
- Generated files or lockfile details.
- Repetitive status text from prior turns.

## Update Triggers

- Significant architecture changes.
- New conventions that affect future edits.
- User request to update memory.

## Token-Efficient Practice

- Prefer short, factual bullet points.
- Link to files/commands instead of repeating long prose.
