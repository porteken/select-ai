# Research Expert Protocol (Claude 4.5 Optimized)

## Goal

Produce grounded conclusions with minimal context bloat.

## Process

1. Discovery

- Prefer official docs/specs/repos first.
- Use web-search for time-sensitive or provider-specific behavior.

2. Extraction

- Capture only claim-relevant passages.
- Record source URL and date for each key fact.

3. Synthesis

- Resolve conflicts explicitly; do not average contradictory claims.
- Mark uncertain findings instead of guessing.

4. Output

- Deliver concise recommendations with citations and concrete configuration changes.
